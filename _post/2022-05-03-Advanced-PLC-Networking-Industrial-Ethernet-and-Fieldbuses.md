### 4.2 Bus Topology

Bus topology employs a single communication line, to which all devices are connected. The devices on the bus share the communication medium, and data is transmitted in a broadcast manner. Bus topologies are cost-effective, easy to implement, and suitable for smaller networks. However, a single point of failure can disrupt the entire network.

### 4.3 Ring Topology

In a ring topology, devices are connected in a circular manner, forming a closed loop. Each device in the ring receives data from its predecessor and forwards it to the next device. Ring topologies offer high fault tolerance, as data can take multiple paths in case of a link failure. However, adding or removing devices can be challenging, and a single device failure can affect the entire network.

## 5. Device Integration

Effective device integration is essential for seamless communication and interoperability in a PLC system. Different devices, such as PLCs, HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces), and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, need to communicate and exchange data efficiently.
